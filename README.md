# PowerBI_Project_1_Brooklyn_Home_Sales

INTRODUCTION

I was asked to analyze and visualize data regarding Home Sales in Brooklyn in 2003 and 2017 years. 
I am interested in details about this topic, so if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also. 

ANALYSIS

To analyze and visualize this data, DAX (Data Analysis Expression) and PowerBI were utilized respectively.
An analysis was conducted so as to find out about the Sales Price of the Building Class in selected neighborhoods in Brooklyn between 2003 and 2017. 
An in-depth analysis was performed in order to show which neighborhood has the greatest popularity in terms of the quantity of sold buildings in this time of period.
The calculation for year over year and month over month Sales were also performed for the Building Class in selected neighborhoods. 
An in-depth analysis was also done to demonstrate Total Sales of entities by MTD, QTD, YTD for the Building Class in selected neighborhoods.
The quantity of Buildings, which were sold greater than 1 Million $, was also calculated.

MAIN CONCLUSIONS

1.	The greatest Sales Price belongs to Rentals Elevator Apartments.
2.	The greatest number of Sold Buildings belongs to Two Family Homes
3.	The majority of Buildings was sold by the price lower than 1 Million $
